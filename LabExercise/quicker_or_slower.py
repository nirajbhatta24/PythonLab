# you live 4 miles from university. The bus drives at 25mph but spends 2 min at each of the 10 stops on the way.
# How long will the bus journey take? Alternatively you could run to the university. you jog the first mile at 7pm;
# then run thw next two at 15mph; before jogging the last at 7mph again. Will this be quicker or slower than the bus?
